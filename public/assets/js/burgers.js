    // type: POST  data: newBurger

// Devoured button - put - updateOne to move devoured to 1
    // need: data-id and data-devoured in handlebars button
    // devoured button clicked - newDevourState = devoured: 1
    // type: PUT data: newDevourState

// Delete button - delete - deleteOne
    // need: data-id
    // DELETE - type: delete

// Non-devoured list - get - selectAll and filter non-devoured and devoured or does this happen in handlebars?
