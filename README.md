## Description
Log all the burgers you have lined up to devour, then delete them from your list once you've tried them! When a burger is added to your log, it will appear in the Try Me! section. When you click the Eat Me! button, the burger will move to the Tried and True! section. Click Delete Me! when you are ready to remove the burger from your log.

This app uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!) and leverages the MVC software design.
